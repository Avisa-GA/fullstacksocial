# Social Web App

My project is a Social website, Users were able to share their thoughts with each other, also share photos, and comment on each other's post and like it . and users must Signup first , and then login, and They can enter to website.
Thank you to our Instructor <strong>Daniel Scott</strong> for offering me great features to add to my project and also for his amazing workshops as always ðŸ’« .
